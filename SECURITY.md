through their specified channels.

# Reporting A Vulnerability

the Pull Requests of their respective repositories. All security
vulnerabilities for the spearmintroblox/spearmintroblox repository (general
miscelannious programs) shall be reported via spearmintroblox's Discord DMs.

# DMCA and Copyright Reporting
